Not released yet, but you can check the code

# Splinker

From "Spline color picker", a convenient tool to easily make and interpolate color palettes.

I have made this tool primarily to answer those use-cases: 
1. Create a full and coherent color palette from a mood-board or an image, for people who know nothing about color theory.
2. Find additional color from an existing color palette with not enough colors.
3. (Bonus if I can) Quickly test a color palette on a few sample (UI, wallpapers, etc).

# Installation 

You need to have python, install the required packages and run main.py
